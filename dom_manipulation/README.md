<h2 align="left">Project Objectives</h2>
<p align="left">In this project, I wrote my code in purely JaveScript. At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:<br>

- Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing” &ensp; You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing” &ensp; You must use console.log(...) to print all output &ensp;You are not allowed to use var.
- Write a script that prints 3 lines: &ensp; The first line: “C is fun” &ensp; The second line: “Python is cool” &ensp; The third line: “JavaScript is amazing” &ensp; You must use console.log(...) to print all output &ensp; You are not allowed to use var.
- Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop. &ensp; The first line: “C is fun” &ensp; The second line: “Python is cool” &ensp;The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
&ensp;You must use console.log(...) to print all output
&ensp;You are not allowed to use var
&ensp;You are not allowed to use any if/else statement
